          The name is legally protected in the European Union and, in Italy,
          exclusive control is exercised over the cheese's production and sale
          by The Consortium of Parmigiano Reggiano, which was created by a
          governmental decree. Each wheel must meet strict criteria early in the
          aging process, when the cheese is still soft and creamy, to merit the
          official seal and be placed in storage for aging. Because it is widely
          imitated, Parmigiano Reggiano has become an increasingly regulated
          product, and in 1955 it became what is known as a certified name
          (which is not the same as a brand name). In 2008, an EU court
          determined that the name Parmesan in Europe only refers to Parmigiano
          Reggiano and cannot be used for imitation Parmesan.[7][8][9] Thus, in
          the European Union, Parmigiano Reggiano is a protected designation of
          origin (PDO); legally, the name refers exclusively to the Parmigiano
          Reggiano PDO cheese manufactured in a limited area in northern Italy.
          Special seals identify the product as authentic, with the
          identification number of the dairy, the production month and year, a
          code identifying the individual wheel, and stamps regarding the length
          of aging.[10] Boursin cheese and biscuits fondue. St. agur blue cheese

        <h3>manchego</h3>
        <p>
          Manchego cheese - or Queso Manchego, as it’s called in its home
          country - is a traditional Spanish cheese made from sheep’s milk. It’s
          protected under the Denominación de Origen (DOP) classification in
          Spain and has been granted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) by
          the EU, which means it can only be produced in a specific region
          (namely, La Mancha) with a particular type of milk from a specific
          breed of sheep, adhering to specific, tightly regulated, rules.
          Manchego cheese is ivory color, with the shade growing darker the more
          it’s aged. It typically has a semi-hard texture (though a young
          Manchego cheese gravitates towards a softer texture) and has a rich,
          complex flavor with buttery, nutty, tart, and sweet undertones all
          mixed together. Which flavor component comes forward, again, depends
          on how long the cheese has been aged. Younger Manchego cheeses have a
          milder but tarter flavor, with a bit of grassiness characteristic of
          cheeses made with sheep milk. Older cheeses have a more strongly
          pronounced buttery richness and nuttiness, with sweet undertones
          becoming more pronounced. The aged Manchego varieties often have
          flavors compared to caramel and butterscotch, though the sweetness
          isn’t overwhelming and is largely balanced with more savory, nutty
          notes. Boursin cheese and biscuits fondue. St. agur blue cheese
